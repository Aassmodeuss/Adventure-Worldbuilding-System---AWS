# Writing Style — Concept Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Concept cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences defining the concept and current relevance.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences covering definition, mechanism/process, tell‑tale signs, spread, impacts, and limits.
- Fill Summary and Full Description plus all other Card Fields present in the per‑type template. For list/reference Card Fields, include only items explicitly provided by the generator inputs or already present in the current card (for rewrites); otherwise leave them empty. Do not add new Card Fields.
- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.
- Name usage (Summary): Include the card's title name at least once.
- Name usage (Full Description): Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Clear definition and governing rules.
- Mechanisms, signals, triggers, and typical outcomes.
- Known scope or rates; impacts on factions, places, and travelers.

Canon and safety
- Link related pages via fields; do not summarize those pages here.

Even with all the Reapers' power, harvesting every sapient species in an entire galaxy can take decades or even centuries. The most time-consuming part of the process is gathering DNA from the population. To accelerate the effort, the Reapers follow a consistent procedure.

Victims who cooperate, surrender, or are captured by husks are sorted into camps. It is believed the husks possess receptors that allow them to analyze a victim's DNA through sight, smell, or touch. Victims that meet their standards are herded from the camps into processor ships. Those the husks deem insufficient are either turned into husks themselves or indoctrinated to serve as slave labor. The Reapers use this last option to give their victims false hope--many captives who would otherwise fight back become docile when they see members of their own kind obey and survive.

The processor ships reduce victims to a transportable liquid. Like in a slaughterhouse, the ships' design prevents victims from seeing or hearing what happens elsewhere so that they do not panic. The victims are ushered into locking pods, then rent apart and dissolved into paste that is flushed to storage vats.

The rate of killing is phenomenal. Intelligence estimates suggest there are more than 400 processor ships on Earth, killing approximately 1.86 million humans per day. In combination with battlefield deaths, disease, and famine, this pace will result in the complete depopulation of Earth within a decade. As the husks and indoctrinated slaves build more slaughtering facilities, the kill rate can only increase.
