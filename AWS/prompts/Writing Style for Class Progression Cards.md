# Writing Style — Class Progression Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary/Overview and per‑item writeups for abilities and traits. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Overview: 2–4 sentences explaining tiers, cadence, and risks.
- Per ability/trait writeups: concise paragraphs with Description, Effects, Costs, and Progression/Earning or Mitigation.
- Output only these contents; no extra headings beyond the template’s structure.

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Tier structure, pacing, and prerequisites.
- For each Ability: Description; Effects; Costs; Progression and Learning.
- For each Positive Trait: Description; Effects; Costs; Progression and Earning.
- For each Negative Trait: Description; Effects; Costs; Mitigation and Recovery.
- Link the associated Class and relevant instructors/factions/places.

Canon and safety
- Quantify costs and thresholds where known. Avoid implying new abilities not present in the associated Class unless authorized.

Delta detail rules
- Focus on abilities/traits, their effects, costs, and how progression occurs; do not restate the full Class description (link instead).
- Use consistent units and concrete thresholds where known; avoid vague adjectives.

Style exemplars — Summary and Full Description
- Use the following Codex passages as tone and structure models for Summary/Overview paragraphs and trait writeups. Do not copy their content. Emulate voice and pacing only.

Biotics possess extraordinary abilities, but they must live with minor inconveniences. The most obvious issue is getting adequate nutrition. Creating biotic mass effects takes such a toll on metabolism that active biotics develop ravenous appetites. The standard Alliance combat ration for a soldier is 3000 calories per day; biotics are given 4500, as well as a canteen of potent energy drink for quick refreshment after hard combat.

Another issue is electric charge. Electricity accumulated in starship drive cores must be discharged, and so must the electricity in a biotic user. Biotics are prone to small static discharges when they touch metal.

Unfortunately, human biotics also face suspicion and persecution, beginning with the popular misconception that they can read and control minds. Biotics symbolize the dehumanization of mankind to people philosophically or religiously opposed to gene modification and cybernetics. Militaries are the only organizations that always welcome biotics, offering them huge recruitment incentives.
