[ENTRY: {Name}]

#### [Biome]
**Name:**  
**Summary:** Biome identity and main survival factors. Write this as a standalone section; do not rely on Full Description. Include the card's title name at least once.  
**Full Description:** 3-8 sentences on ecology, movement, and recurring risks. Write this as a standalone section; do not rely on Summary. Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).  
**local inhabitants:** list biome-wide recurring hazards (e.g., Shadow Panther) or "None"  
**Tone Keywords:** 3-5 anchors.  
**Locations of Note:** locations contained within the biome (if any)  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:** 1-3 concise bullets describing potential interactions, quests, or story events within this biome.

Pre-save checklist
- Parent points to its region.  
- local inhabitants use the stricter presence rule (recurring hazard, not generic fauna).  
- Locations of Note only if you have subordinate locations.
