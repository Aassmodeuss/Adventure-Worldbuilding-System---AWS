**Full Description:** 3-8 sentences on layout, function, economy, governance, risks, and routes. Write this as a standalone section; do not rely on Summary. Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).  
**local inhabitants:** list domiciled characters, governing factions, and location-specific recurring hazards, or "None"  
**Tone Keywords:** 3-5 anchors.  
**Locations of Note:** subordinate points or contained areas (if any)

- Locations of Note only if points exist.
