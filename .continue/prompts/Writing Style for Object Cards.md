# Writing Style — Object Cards (Non‑Armor)

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Object: General cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences stating what the object is and what it does.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences on composition, mechanism, activation/use, storage/maintenance, and limits/risks.
- Fill Summary and Full Description plus all other Card Fields present in the per‑type template. For list/reference Card Fields, include only items explicitly provided by the generator inputs or already present in the current card (for rewrites); otherwise leave them empty. Do not add new Card Fields.
- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.
- Name usage (Summary): Include the card's title name at least once.
- Name usage (Full Description): Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Design and materials; intended function and operational mechanism.
- How it’s used, maintained, and stored; legal or safety constraints.
- Practical limits (capacity, duration, recharge) with quantified ranges when known.
- Typical makers and users (brief, factual).

Medi-gel is a common medicinal salve used by paramedics, EMTs, and military personnel. It combines several useful applications: a local anesthetic, disinfectant and clotting agent all in one. Once applied, the gel is designed to grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids - most notably blood - as well as contaminants and gasses.

The gel is a genetically-engineered bioplasm created by the Sirta Foundation, a medical technology megacorp based on Earth. Technically, medi-gel violates Council laws against genetic engineering, but so far, it has proved far too useful to ban.
