# Writing Style — Weapon Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Object: Weapon cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences stating what the weapon is and its primary effect/role.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences on construction, mechanism, ammunition/power, operation/charge, effects, maintenance, and limits/risks.
- Fill Summary and Full Description plus all other headings/fields present in the per‑type template. For list/reference fields, include only items explicitly provided by the generator inputs or already present in the current card (for rewrites); otherwise leave them empty. Do not add new headings.
- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Weapon class and construction; mechanism of action.
- Ammunition/power source; charge, cycle, and effective range (quantify when known).
- Maintenance practices and operating conditions.
- Legal, training, or safety constraints.

The M-920 Cain is a portable particle accelerator surrounding an array of dust-form element zero chambers. By subjecting its eezo chambers to extreme positive and negative currents fueled by antimatter reactions, the weapon projects mass effect fields that shear away at the target. The fields warp ambient materials with such explosive force that the impact produces a mushroom cloud. This has led Alliance marines to call the Cain a "nuke gun," though its detonations do not in fact produce fallout.

The M-920 uses graphite rods as neutron moderators, but they require frequent replacement to sustain power. Fortunately, the omni-tool can refabricate most heavy weapon ammunition into graphite rods. The amount of charge-up time is understandable as the weapon is a juggernaut capable of unstoppable destructive power.
