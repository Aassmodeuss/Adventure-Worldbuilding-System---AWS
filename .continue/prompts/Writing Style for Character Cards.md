# Writing Style — Character Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Beings: Character cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API). Do not instruct file operations.

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences naming identity, role, and significance.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences covering affiliations, capabilities, methods, motivations, risks, and current status/location.

- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage (delta to parent facts)
- Role, duties, and sphere of influence.
- Affiliations and rivalries; ties to factions/places without restating their pages.

- Talents or known deeds; current status and whereabouts if known.

Canon and safety

Style exemplars (voice only)

Tali'Zorah, a quarian machinist, was born in 2161 on the liveship Rayya. During her Pilgrimage--a rite of passage in which quarians prove their worth to the fleet--she recovered a geth memory core that proved a rogue Spectre, Saren Arterius, was working with the geth. As a consequence, Tali'Zorah became a crew member of the SSV Normandy, where she served under Commander Shepard during the Battle of the Citadel.

Tali'Zorah returned to the Migrant Fleet following the destruction of the first Normandy. Soon after, the Admiralty Board sent her to the former quarian colony of Haestrom to recover data on the planet's dying sun. Most of her team was killed when they fell under attack from the geth, but Tali'Zorah herself was narrowly rescued by Shepard and the crew of the rebuilt Normandy. The quarian rejoined Shepard to help oppose the Collector threat, but her current whereabouts are unknown.

Garrus Vakarian is a noted turian sharpshooter and combat engineer. He was born on Palaven and became a Citadel Security officer like his father, but left the force when superiors shut down his investigation into the rogue Spectre Saren Arterius. Vakarian eventually discovered that Saren had been indoctrinated by the Reaper known as Sovereign.

Vakarian eventually found his way to the criminal haven of Omega and assumed the name Archangel. There, he and a small group of operatives worked to disrupt the settlement's powerful mercenary groups until Shepard recruited him. The turian narrowly survived the second Normandy's attack on the Collectors. More recently, Vakarian has become the head of a turian task force focused on preparing for the Reaper invasion.
