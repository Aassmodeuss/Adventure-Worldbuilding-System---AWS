### The Blight
The Blight is a pervasive magical corruption emanating from within the Whispering Caverns. Contrary to popular belief, it predates the Shattering and Greenwood itself; its true origin remains unknown. Sustained exposure is required for infection to take hold in a region or living host, though certain corrupted creatures or objects can accelerate transmission directly. The Blight mutates bodies-plants and animals alike-while twisting minds toward aggression and violence. Once fully entrenched there is no known cure, yet early-stage infections in sentient beings can sometimes be purged by powerful magic or specialized potions. Those irreversibly altered are called the Baned, shunned and treated like lepers. Fire is the mandated method to purge Blighted plants and corpses, preventing further spread.
