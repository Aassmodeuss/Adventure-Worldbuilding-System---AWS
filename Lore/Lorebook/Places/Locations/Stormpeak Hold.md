[ENTRY: Stormpeak Hold]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Stormpeak Hold  
**Summary:** Ancestral seat of the Stormpeak clan, a vast subterranean fortress built for a population far larger than today's numbers.  
**Full Description:** Stormpeak Hold extends through stacked galleries, foundries, and vaults cut deep into the mountain. Upper levels maintain active workshops, armories, and clan halls; many ancient lower tiers are sealed or abandoned after cave-ins and war losses. Service shafts and delvings link to the Rootlands in controlled sections, providing trade and risk in equal measure. Gateworks and kill-corridors defend the main approaches, and surface entries are limited to fortified doors and lift wells. Slow population recovery from their losses during the Wars of the Crowns due to dwarves low birth rate constrains output, but the Hold retains smithing excellence and maintains key pass infrastructure across the range.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** subterranean, fortified, diminished, industrial, ancestral  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Reopen a sealed lower tier to restore access to a foundry line.  
- Negotiate passage terms for a high-risk convoy through the pass gates.  
- Interdict duergar raiders using Rootlands shafts without collapsing trade links.
