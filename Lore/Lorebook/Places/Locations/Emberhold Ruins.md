[ENTRY: Emberhold Ruins]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Emberhold Ruins  
**Summary:** Former Varden Ranger stronghold at the mouth of the Whispering Caverns. Razed in 680:AF during Malakai's siege.  
**Full Description:** Founded in 100:AF as a ranger outpost, Emberhold grew on treasure traffic from the Whispering Caverns and trade from the Stormpeak foothills. Wealth and distance brought near-independence from Verdant Hall, and it became the Rangers' largest settlement and de facto headquarters outside the capital. In 680:AF, Malakai's forces besieged and razed the site after his coup, breaking one of the last organized holdouts. Stormpeak dwarven masonry still spans the valley mouth in ruined galleries above and below ground. Current approaches are unstable: collapsed walks, trapped service tunnels, and ash-split lintels block direct access to the main gate. The ruins serve as a staging point for rare expeditions into the caverns.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** ruined, siege-scarred, multi-level, unstable, fortified  
**Locations of Note:** Emberhold Undercity, Emberhold Archives  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Recover siege orders, wounded rolls, or Foxfire caches from collapsed galleries to settle old accusations.  
- Clear and secure a dwarven service tunnel to re-establish a forward post at the caverns' mouth.  
- Navigate unstable vaults to salvage bolter parts and ward-stone fragments under load-bearing risk.  
- Parley with a scavenger guild holding the only safe route through a trapped underpass.
