[ENTRY: Verdant Hall]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Verdant Hall  
**Summary:** Greenwood's former treetop capital founded in 0:AF. Destroyed in 700:AF when the Heart of the Forest shattered, triggering the Shattering.  
**Full Description:** Verdant Hall united Greenwood's peoples under a High Council and relied on the Varden Rangers to maintain order across the realms. In 700:AF an arcane detonation coinciding with the Heart's destruction reduced the city to ruin and began the Shattering. The site now lies within the Shadowlands, where the canopy admits little light and predatory growth has overrun spans and courts. Surviving vaults and council archives remain behind sealed growth and collapsed walks. The ruins serve as a reference point for Shadowlands patrol routes and containment mapping.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** ruined, lightless, central, sealed, hazardous  
**Locations of Note:** Council Chambers (collapsed), Heart dais (ruined)  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Reach a stranded team on a fractured span, decide to cut free for retreat or hold against climbing growth.  
- Breach a sealed council archive and extract ledgers before encroachment closes the route.  
- Map a safe traverse around the Heart dais and update containment charts for patrols.
