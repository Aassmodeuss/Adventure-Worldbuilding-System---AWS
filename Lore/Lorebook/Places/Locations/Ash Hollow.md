[ENTRY: Ash Hollow]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Ash Hollow  
**Summary:** Waystation on the Ashlands' northern edge that sells safe water and controls caravan passage.  
**Full Description:** The settlement circles a deep freshwater spring. Cisterns, ceramic filters, and ration tokens govern every draw. Fused timber and slagged glass walls show shardfall scars from the Shattering. Water tariffs are posted by vessel and volume at dawn. Caravans resupply, trade salvage, and hire guides and guards before moving north or south. Vexa Blackslate enforces reserve quotas and closes taps when levels fall.
**local inhabitants:** Vexa Blackslate, Caravan Guild  
**Tone Keywords:** parched, scarcity, barter, vigilance, endurance  
**Locations of Note:** Caravan Guild Office  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Broker water rights between rival caravans, prevent a riot at the well.  
- Unmask a siphon ring stealing night-drip from the spring, decide whether to blackmail its members or break it.  
- Repair a cracked cistern wall before the next ash storm, choose between speed and quality.
