[ENTRY: Storm's Throat]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Storm's Throat  
**Summary:** Fortified toll town at the river's canyon throat. Passage is controlled by walls, chains, and coin.  
**Full Description:** Opposing cliff piers and two fortified walls span the river's narrowest reach. Gateways admit multiple vessels; portcullises and spiked chains stop toll-evaders. Governance rests with the Pentad, a council of five bosses. Dwarves once held the site; human forces took control during the Crown Wars. After the Shattering and the Ashlands' burning, the garrison withdrew south and gangs consolidated control. Slaver galleys, pirate sloops, and merchant barges crowd the piers.
**local inhabitants:** The Pentad, Caravan Guild  
**Tone Keywords:** tolled, fortified, illicit, mercantile, chokepoint  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Negotiate seasonal toll remissions for Warden convoys under drought conditions.  
- Expose a Pentad skimming scheme at the east pier weighhouse, decide restitution.  
- Cut a seized barge free during a chain drop, thread the canyon under fire.
