[ENTRY: Emberhold Archives]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Emberhold Archives  
**Summary:** An ancient warded tower repurposed by the Varden Rangers to store Greenwood records. It sealed after Emberhold's fall.  
**Full Description:** The Archives occupy a stone tower carved into the stump of a colossal tree. Unknown builders laid the base structure; later Rangers adapted it for manuscripts and ledgers. Ancient wards render the tower effectively invulnerable to physical attack and nullify spells cast from outside. Enchantments repel pests and decay, allowing indefinite storage of supplies and records. The design favors sustained defense by a small garrison with limited entries and internal kill-lines. After Malakai's siege destroyed Emberhold, Ranger scribes sealed the tower. No verified breach has been recorded since.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** warded, sealed, archival, defensive, preserved  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Discover a viable access method-ritual sequence, ward key, or maintenance lull-that briefly bypasses the seals.  
- Recover Foxfire route maps or handler ledgers to resolve disputes about past betrayals.  
- Bargain with a Dreamworld echo bound to the wards to exchange answers for service.
