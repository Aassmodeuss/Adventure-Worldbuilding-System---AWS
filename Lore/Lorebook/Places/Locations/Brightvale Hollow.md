[ENTRY: Brightvale Hollow]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Brightvale Hollow  
**Summary:** Small canopy settlement built inside a living oak's hollow, home to Bosari families and a few Kitsune.  
**Full Description:** Walkways ring the inner trunk and link to rope bridges at the crown. Cisterns catch canopy rain, and resin seals food bins and jars. Hunters range the mid-boughs and post night watches for climbing predators. Slaver tally marks on the inner bark date to the Wars of the Crowns. A sealed knot door hides an emergency drop to the forest floor.  
**local inhabitants:** Brightvale Council  
**Tone Keywords:** sheltered, vigilant, canopy, continuity, small-scale  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Repair storm-cut bridges before trade season, ration cordage and resin.  
- Investigate scratch marks high on the trunk, set night watches until the source is found.  
- Open the sealed knot door, decide who descends and how to secure the drop.
