[ENTRY: Emberhold Undercity]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Emberhold Undercity  
**Summary:** Dwarven-laid galleries, cisterns, and store vaults beneath Emberhold. Flooding, collapses, and gas pockets complicate access.  
**Full Description:** The undercity extends beneath the valley mouth in stacked galleries and culverts tied to old cisterns. Service tunnels once fed dwarf-built lifts and granaries; many spans now lie collapsed or pinched by ash-split stone. Silted channels and blocked sluices flood lower levels after storms, and sour gas pools in sealed vaults. Ward stones mark safer ribs, but Blight seep appears in pockets near cavern mouths. Smugglers and scavengers use echo-quiet routes to avoid the patrols of dwarveb constructs and traps left from the siege. Access points open within the ruins' courtyards and along the cliff face.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** vaulted, drowned, trapped, residual, dwarven  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Clear a choked culvert to drain a flooded level and recover stowed crates.  
- Map echo-safe routes to bypass collapse zones and gas pockets.  
- Trace a smuggler line to a live vault without tripping siege traps.
