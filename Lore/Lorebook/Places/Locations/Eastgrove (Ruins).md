[ENTRY: Eastgrove (Ruins)]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Eastgrove (Ruins)  
**Aliases:** Eastgrove  
**Summary:** Eastwood's shattered twin to Westgrove. Shardfall broke its circles. Root-choked ruins remain.  
**Full Description:** Eastgrove sat near Eastwood's center and once matched Westgrove's grove design. The Shattering dropped shards through the canopy and broke stone circles and ancient wards. Walkways collapsed and the grove burned. Survivors carried what lore they could to Westgrove. Rumor holds a sealed sanctum still sleeps below the charred roots.  
**Tone Keywords:** broken, hushed, reclaimed, secret, wary  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Clear a safe route to an inner ring, mark stable limbs, avoid shard-wakes.  
- Test a ward fragment against Blight creep, decide to seal or extract it.  
- Search for the heart-sanctum beneath charred roots before a quarry team disturbs seals.
