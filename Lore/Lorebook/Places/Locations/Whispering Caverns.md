[ENTRY: Whispering Caverns]

#### [Location]
**Name:** Whispering Caverns  
**Summary:** A vast network of echoing chambers beneath Eastwood's eastern rim. Voices are heard in the depths, and few who enter return.  
**Full Description:** The caverns extend for leagues under Eastwood's escarpments, with flooded pockets, sheer drops, and unstable roofs. Travelers report disembodied whispering at junctions and along long vaults. Blight signs increase with depth, and animal paths avoid active mouths. Survivors bring out artifacts of unknown origin and show signs of fixation or sleep loss after return. Many circles hold that the system was once part of the Rootlands and was severed in forgotten ages by magic or slow shift. The main entrance sits below the ruins of Emberhold.  
**Local Inhabitants:** Blighted  
**Tone Keywords:** echoing, unstable, obsessive, severed, perilous  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**
