#### [Location]
**Name:** Westgrove  
**Summary:** Westgrove is a secluded druid settlement built within a colossal stump and is the last large druid enclave in Greenwood after Eastgrove fell.
**Full Description:** Westgrove occupies the stump of a colossal tree, with crownways and rope walks connecting it to nearby paths and posts. The Westwood Druid Circle gathers here to judge Blight signs, assign ward duties, and train initiates. Visitors stay in living halls, while posted watches monitor the high approaches. Aid is given in exchange for proof of need, labor, or supplies. Ward stones encircle the rim paths, and crews inspect lines after storms. The settlement is guarded and ritual-focused, emphasizing stewardship and canopy life.
