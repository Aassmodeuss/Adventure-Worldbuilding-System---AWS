[ENTRY: The Southlands]

#### [Realm]
**Name:** The Southlands  
**Summary:** A collection of human kingdoms south of the Ashlands. The realm fractured after the last emperor died without an heir, sparking the Wars of the Crowns.  
**Full Description:** The Southlands comprise rival crowns and city-states linked by river corridors and coastal caravan roads. Succession collapse in 400:AF triggered a century of conflict (the Wars of the Crowns, 400-500:AF) as vassal realms declared independence and fought for primacy. Human polities hired, conscripted, or enslaved neighboring non-human peoples, seeding long-lived mistrust beyond their borders. Trade routes run through Storm's Head River and the toll gates at Storm's Throat, while overland passage must skirt or cross the Ashlands. Fragmented governance persists; alliances shift with harvests, war levies, and river control. Greenwood contacts the Southlands chiefly by river traffic and rare Ashlands crossings.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** fragmented, martial, mercantile, river-linked, human-dominated  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Broker safe-conducts and toll remissions for upriver caravans during levy season.  
- Track slaver flotillas using Southlands charters, interdict before they reach Storm's Throat.  
- Negotiate a post-war grain-for-timber compact to stabilize border markets.
