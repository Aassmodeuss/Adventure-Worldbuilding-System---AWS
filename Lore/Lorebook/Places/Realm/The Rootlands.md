[ENTRY: The Rootlands]

#### [Realm]
**Name:** The Rootlands  
**Summary:** A subterranean realm of stacked caverns, blind rivers, and fungal forests beneath Elrune.  
**Full Description:** The Rootlands extend through layered caverns, lava tubes, and fault cracks beneath much of Elrune. Fungal forests and blind rivers support city-states of Duergar, Gorlek, and Ratlings, linked by guarded caravan roads. Light and noise attract predators; travelers favor hooded lamps, echo taps, and scent marks to navigate. Trade moves ore, salts, alchemical spores, and captives; toll gates and slave routes sustain raiders and gateholds. Roof falls, floods, and Blight seep continually redraw passages. All known connections between the Whispering Caverns and the Rootlands collapsed or were lost long ago.
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** lightless, vertical, fungal, besieged, treacherous  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Chart a bypass around a roof fall, update route beacons.  
- Break a slave chain at a choke point, hold against the counter-raid.  
- Bargain safe passage at a duergar gatehold, trade metal for water and lamp-oil.
