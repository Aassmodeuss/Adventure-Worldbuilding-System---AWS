[ENTRY: Greenwood]

#### [Realm]
**Name:** Greenwood  
**Summary:** Vast, dangerous forest realm with towering trees and canopy routes. Severed from other realms since the Shattering.
**Full Description:** Greenwood rises with colossal trunks and crownways above a predator-filled forest floor. Peoples include Bosari, Kitsune, fey, and druid circles. The Forsaken Lands hem its borders-Shadowlands to the west and Ashlands to the south-forcing detours and closures. The Shattering severed many external links; traffic persists on Storm's Head River and occasional Ashlands crossings. Movement relies on ranger paths, river corridors, and living bridges connecting regions. Governance and culture vary regionally, with canopy trade preserving scattered interregional contact.
**Tone Keywords:** ancient, layered, traveled, encroached, living  
**Locations of Note:** Westwood, Eastwood, Stormpeak Mountains, Wyrmspine Mountains, Storm's Head River  

**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Coordinate patrols along shifting Forsaken Lands borders.
- Repair a fallen crownway to strengthen regional trade.
