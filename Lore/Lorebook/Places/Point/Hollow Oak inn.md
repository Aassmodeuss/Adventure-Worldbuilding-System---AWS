[ENTRY: Hollow Oak Inn]

#### [Point]
**Name:** Hollow Oak Inn  



**Summary:** A small tavern and lodging post on Westgrove's western edge that serves visiting druids and travelers.  
**Full Description:** The inn occupies a hollowed great oak reinforced with ribbed beams and clay chinking. The owner, Haldrin Slate, a heavyset Bosari keeper, tracks beds, meal tallies, and herb orders on slate strips. A short counter offers stews, root breads, and clean water drawn under Circle oversight. Common tables host quiet trade talks, route planning, and story exchanges after dusk. Visiting druids barter spores, seeds, or minor curatives for lodging credits. Noise limits are posted and enforced to preserve rituals nearby.  
**local inhabitants:** Haldrin Slate (Bosari); rotating druid guests; travelers  
**Tone Keywords:** lodging, quiet, barter, herb, slate
