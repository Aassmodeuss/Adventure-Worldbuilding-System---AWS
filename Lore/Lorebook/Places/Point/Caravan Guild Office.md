[ENTRY: Caravan Guild Office]

#### [Point]
**Name:** Caravan Guild Office  
**Summary:** The Caravan Guild Office is a point facility that regulates spring water draws and convoy escort slots in Ash Hollow.  
**Full Description:** Clerks raise shutters at dawn and post water rates and convoy slots. A barred counter separates lockboxes, tally slates, and sealed ink pots from the queue. Guards stamp each barrel and record escort rotations before release. Disputes move to a side room with a witness, ledger copy, and clean slate to reduce tampering risk. Night staff reconcile stamps against spring quotas and flag anomalies for review. Repeat offenders lose slot priority and may face Guild fines.  
**Local Inhabitants:** Caravan Guild clerks; hired guards  
**Tone Keywords:** audit, ration, dispatch, stamp, quota  
**Locations of Note:** Ash Hollow (spring)  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Expose forged barrel stamps and decide fines or blacklisting.  
- Rush a late convoy onto the schedule by trading a future favor for slot access.  
- Trace missing water tallies to a siphon scheme hidden in night ledgers.  
- Negotiate shared escort terms between rival caravans before an ash storm departure.
