[ENTRY: The Dreamworld]

#### [World]
**Name:** The Dreamworld  
**Summary:** A boundary between the waking world and the spirit world, a forest in eternal twilight used for petition, communion, and distant contact.  
**Full Description:** The Dreamworld appears as a forest in eternal twilight at the boundary of the waking and spirit worlds. Undisciplined thought can manifest danger and distort reality. Time flows irregularly. Linger too long and the sleeper's body may die. Wounds suffered here do not affect the waking body, but emotional trauma can remain. The Dreamworld can be used to speak with spirits of the dead, commune with other dreamwalkers, or petition powerful resident beings for aid or knowledge. Some are born with an innate gift for dreamwalking; others can learn.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** twilight, liminal, petition, hazard, time-drift  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Establish and test anchor protocols against time drift and thought hazards.  
- Recover a lost walker's trail and return them before the body fails.  
- Present a formal petition to a resident power for guidance or remedy.
