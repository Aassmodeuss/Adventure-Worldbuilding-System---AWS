[ENTRY: Blightbogs]

#### [Biome]
**Name:** Blightbogs  
**Summary:** Marsh basins where stagnant water concentrates Blight. Footing is deceptive and paths shift after storms.  
**Full Description:** Stagnant pools lie dark under scum and drifting pollen. Root and peat mats conceal sinkholes that collapse under weight. Sour gas accumulates in pockets and ignites when exposed to flame. Leechvines, biting midges, and blight-hardened fungi dominate low hummocks and fallen timber. Storms shift reed markers and reroute flooded channels overnight. Teams probe with poles, lay corduroy, and work upwind to avoid gas.
**local inhabitants:** Leechvines, Blighted  
**Tone Keywords:** stagnant, toxic, concealed, predatory, unstable  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Lay a corduroy causeway across a bog, vent gas pockets, cut back leechvines.  
- Harvest blight fungus for antidote trials, avoid spore fever and tool pitting.  
- Track a missing caravan by reed markers and torn peat, move before the markers drift.
