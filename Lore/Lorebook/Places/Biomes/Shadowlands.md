[ENTRY: Shadowlands]

#### [Biome]
**Name:** Shadowlands  
**Summary:** Light-starved biome formed during the Shattering. Predatory growth, spores, and gas pockets make floor travel lethal.  
**Full Description:** Shardfall left a canopy so dense that light rarely reaches the floor. Carnivorous vines, blind predators, and spore-forming fungi dominate the undergrowth. Gas pockets collect in hollows and vent after storms. Shard-scarred treants strike at movement near root lines and flagged paths. Teams travel by hooded lantern, flag safe spans, and reopen routes after blowdowns. Floor movement is avoided except under heavy escort.
**local inhabitants:** Shadow Panther  
**Tone Keywords:** lightless, constricted, predatory, fungal, volatile  
**Locations of Note:** Verdant Hall  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Move by hooded amber light and secure gear, avoid drawing under-canopy hunters.  
- Cut and burn a vine kill-zone to reopen a canopy span.  
- Sample spore plumes after storms, mark safe windows for travel.
