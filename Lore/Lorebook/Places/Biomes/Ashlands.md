[ENTRY: Ashlands]

#### [Biome]
**Name:** Ashlands  
**Summary:** Burned desert band formed during the Shattering along Greenwood's southern border. Water is scarce, stored, and tightly controlled.  
**Full Description:** Burned ground and fused ash sheets define the band along Greenwood's southern rim. Water persists only at deep springs, rock seeps, and old cisterns. Ash storms cut visibility and scour exposed skin and cloth. Small Ashlander tribes guard wells, sell access, and raid refusers. Long crossings favor the Storm's Head River via Storm's Throat or the wagon routes through Ash Hollow spring.
**local inhabitants:** Ashlander Tribes  
**Tone Keywords:** scorched, scarce, exposed, hostile, windborne  
**Locations of Note:** Ash Hollow, Storm's Throat  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Map a chain of safe stops between springs, cache supplies before the next storm.  
- Negotiate shared access to a seep, trade repair work and tools instead of blood.  
- Guard a river barge through the Ashlands reach, choose between speed or stealth when raiders shadow the banks.
