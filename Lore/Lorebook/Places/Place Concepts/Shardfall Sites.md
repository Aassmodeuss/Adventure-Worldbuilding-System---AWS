[ENTRY: Shardfall Sites]

#### [Place Concept]
**Name:** Shardfall Sites  
**Summary:** Ground altered where Heart fragments fell during the Shattering; magic behaves erratically and trails divert. Sites remain corrupted.  
**Full Description:** During the Shattering, Heart fragments impacted and permanently altered local ecologies. Wards and charms behave unreliably near these sites, and animal paths divert around them. Early-era shardfields were sometimes cleansed, but entrenched sites endured and now anchor adjacent Forsaken Lands. Sap and resin fused into glassy growths, and nearby treants and dryads often show luminous bark scars and unstable behavior.  
**Tone Keywords:** residual, corrupted, ward-bent, luminous, hazardous  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Survey an entrenched site's boundary and map ward failures for containment planning.  
- Recover components from stable glass growths without triggering a dormant wake.  
- Cross-reference historic shardfall ledgers to predict linked Forsaken expansion.
