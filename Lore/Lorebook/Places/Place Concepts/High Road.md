[ENTRY: High Road]

#### [Place Concept]
**Name:** High Road  
**Summary:** Interconnected canopy paths and bridges predating the Shattering that enable travel above Greenwood's forest floor.  
**Full Description:** The High Road ties major trunks with lashed timberways, woven rope spans, and stone-buttressed walks. Before the Shattering, it carried long caravans across regions without touching the ground. Shardfall snapped anchors and fused sap into glassy scars, leaving the network patchwork and uneven. Rot, wind damage, and Blight-grown vines claim neglected spans, so weight limits and wind flags mark safe crossings. Fire is forbidden; a single spark can consume a mile of road. Ashanar riggers, Bosari hunters, Kitsune scouts, and Zhilakai weavers keep sections serviceable where they can. Maintenance posts levy tolls in labor or goods, and patrols reopen routes after major storms.  
**Tone Keywords:** canopy, infrastructure, precarious, maintained, patchwork  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Identify and stop a saboteur swapping wind flags to send caravans onto thin wood.  
- Recover a fallen cargo crate wedged below a span before drakes scent it.  
- Escort Ashanar riggers to re-string a span skirting the Shadowlands where leechvines hunt.  
- Negotiate a common toll charter between rival posts to reopen a Warden supply lane.
