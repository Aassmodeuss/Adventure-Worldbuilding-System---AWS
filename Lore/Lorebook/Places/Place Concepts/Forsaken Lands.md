[ENTRY: Forsaken Lands]

#### [Place Concept]
**Name:** Forsaken Lands  
**Summary:** Collective term for Greenwood regions transformed during the Shattering and sustained by entrenched Blight. Each form presents distinct risks.  
**Full Description:** The Forsaken Lands are areas permanently altered when Heart fragments fell during the Shattering and where Blight persists. Known forms include the light-starved Shadowlands, the desert-like Ashlands, and marsh basins called Blightbogs. New variants occasionally appear as conditions shift and corruption adapts. Wardens, druid circles, and traders use the term to plan routes, set containment lines, and prioritize burns.  
**Tone Keywords:** corrupted, persistent, hazardous, mapped, evolving  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Update a regional risk ledger after a containment breach, adjust routes and burn orders.  
- Compare samples from different forms to test a shared countermeasure.
