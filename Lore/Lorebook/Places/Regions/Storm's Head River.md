[ENTRY: Storm's Head River]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Storm's Head River  
**Summary:** Principal river corridor from the Stormpeak foothills through the Ashlands to the Southlands. Trade and passage depend on seasonal flow and control points.  
**Full Description:** Flowing south from the Stormpeak foothills, the river threads Greenwood and the Ashlands before reaching the Southlands. It remains a viable commercial route after the Shattering. Traffic concentrates at fortified control points, notably Storm's Throat. Seasonal floods, ash storms, and shifting sandbars complicate navigation along the Ashlands reach. River syndicates, Wardens, and Guild factors contest fees, escorts, and salvage rights.
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** arterial, tolled, seasonal, contested, southbound  
**Locations of Note:** Storm's Throat
