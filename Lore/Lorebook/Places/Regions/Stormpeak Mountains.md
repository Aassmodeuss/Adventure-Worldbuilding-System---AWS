[ENTRY: Stormpeak Mountains]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Stormpeak Mountains  
**Summary:** North-south spine dividing Westwood and Eastwood. Severe weather and narrow passes control movement between regions.  
**Full Description:** The range runs from Wyrmspine to the Ashlands rim. Crossings rely on seasonal passes, fixed ladders, and ridge paths subject to closure. Deep mines, abandoned shafts, and dwarven halls honeycomb the roots. Rockfall, whiteouts, and spring avalanches cut routes without warning. Old delvings connect to the Rootlands below, offering refuge and risk. Caravans stage at pass towns and hire local guides.
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** alpine, dividing, mined, hazardous, weather-bound  
**Locations of Note:** Stormpeak Hold  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Mark and maintain a seasonal pass, reset flags after storms.  
- Clear an abandoned shaft to restore a protected traverse between valleys.  
- Broker passage terms with Stormpeak Hold for a high-risk convoy.
