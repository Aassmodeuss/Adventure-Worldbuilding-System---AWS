[ENTRY: Devil's Thorn Mountains]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Devil's Thorn Mountains  
**Summary:** A steep mountain chain on Greenwood's eastern border that controls access to the Whispering Caverns and the Eastwood rim.  
**Full Description:** The chain forms a broken wall above Greenwood's eastern escarpment. Limestone and basalt spines rise in clustered thorns and funnel wind through narrow cols. Ridges carry sparse crownwood and exposed roots. Soil is thin and dries fast. Cave mouths along the lower skirts breathe cold air. Faint whispers carry from deeper veins on still nights. Old ranger traverses cling to ledges and bridge crack funnels with rope or dwarven anchor pins. Access routes skirt loose scree and shardfall scars along the outer rim. Blight signs are limited at elevation and increase downslope near the caverns. Guide marks note safe grips with resin dots and warn of trimmed hazard slivers. Weather shifts quickly. Ice beads on lines at dawn and melts by midday into blinding mist.  
**Geography/Climate:** High relief. Thin soils. Rapid temperature swings. Frequent ash and mist pulses.  
**Travel and Hazards:** Sheer drops, loose scree, wind funnels, sudden ice melt, and false cave floors. Rope failure and marker loss are common incident triggers.  
**Locations of Note:** Whispering Caverns (approach mouths)  
**Tone Keywords:** steep, thorned, wind-cut, exposed, fissured  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Survey a collapsed traverse, replace anchor pins, and log grip resin patterns for future teams.  
- Clear a scree chute threatening the only stable approach to Eastgrove's inner pocket.  
- Chart safe cave mouth entries, test echo behavior, and flag Blight seep warnings.  
- Recover a lost ranger rope kit lodged on an ice shelf before thaw undermines ledge access.
