[ENTRY: Wyrmspine Mountains]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Wyrmspine Mountains  
**Summary:** Northern mountain border of Greenwood. Glaciated ridgelines and tunnel networks shape limited overland contact.  
**Full Description:** Glaciated ridgelines, narrow cols, and unstable scree limit overland routes. Crossings rely on seasonal passes, fixed ladders, and ridge paths. Ancient tunnel networks link to the Rootlands below under Gorlek and Ratling control. Weather closes routes without warning, and avalanches follow spring thaws. Warden presence is light; caravans hire local guides.
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** alpine, isolated, glaciated, precarious, porous-border  
**Locations of Note:** None  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Scout and mark a seasonal pass, set cairns and warning flags.  
- Broker a ceasefire at a tunnel mouth between Bearclaw and Gorlek clans.  
- Evacuate a village before thaw-season avalanches cut the ridge path.
