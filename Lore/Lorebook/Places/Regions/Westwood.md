[ENTRY: Westwood]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Westwood  
**Summary:** Western Greenwood region defined by dense crownways and constrained borders. Dangerous wildlife limits ground access and shaps daily life.  
**Full Description:** Dense canopy spans support long routes above the forest floor. Travel relies on crownways, living bridges, and flagged paths. Patrols reopen spans after storms and cut back leechvines where the blight encroaches. Ground movement is restricted by large predators, and blight pockets near Forsaken Lands. Settlements cluster along old ranger paths and druid groves focused on maintenance and containment.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** dense, patrolled, encroached, canopy, border  
**Locations of Note:** Brightvale Hollow, Westgrove
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Shift boundary totems as the Shadowlands advances toward key trails.  
- Scout for fresh seeps along the Ashlands rim to resupply long patrols.  
- Guide a canopy caravan around new kill-zones where leechvines choke the High Road.  
- Broker passage rights between river couriers and local Bosari wardens.  
- Track shardfall drift by testing blight in root beds and reporting to the Circle.
