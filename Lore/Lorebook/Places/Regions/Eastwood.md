[ENTRY: Eastwood]

#### [Region]
**Name:** Eastwood  
**Summary:** Eastern Greenwood of steep ridges and thinning canopy. Risks rise near Emberhold and the Greenwood-facing mouths of the Whispering Caverns.  
**Full Description:** Steep ridges, broken ravines, and thinning canopy restrict movement. Travel favors crownways and high spans along old ranger routes. Predators range the mid-boughs, and floor travel is avoided. Patrol presence and settlement are limited, and Blight signs increase toward the caverns. Emberhold's ruins span the mouth of the valley approache to the Whispering Caverns.  
**local inhabitants:** None  
**Tone Keywords:** steep, sparse, predatory, ruin-haunted, exposed  
**Locations of Note:** Emberhold Ruins, Eastgrove (Ruins)  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Reopen a ranger path to Emberhold, clear deadfalls and mark safe spans.  
- Escort a caravan to a Kaz'Kek trade perch, barter cordage and water for passage.  
- Establish a staging camp above the Greenwood-facing caverns, balance concealment, access, and water.
