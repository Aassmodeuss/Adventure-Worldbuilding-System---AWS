### Leechvines
Leechvines are carnivorous creepers that carpet dim trails within the Shadowlands. Thick mats hide coiled tendrils beneath leaf-litter and rot. The plant senses breath, heat and footfall vibration, then throws barbed loops that cinch fast. Each strand bears capillary thorns that wick blood and sap into swollen nodes along the stem.

Old growth drops bait pods with a sweet-rot scent to draw prey into reach. Anticoagulant sap keeps wounds flowing while the vine drinks. Fire makes the outer strands recoil, but buried runners survive unless the mat is fully burned through. Wardens carry hook-knives, pitch torches and ash to clear short crossings; cutting alone leaves live nodes that knit back overnight.
