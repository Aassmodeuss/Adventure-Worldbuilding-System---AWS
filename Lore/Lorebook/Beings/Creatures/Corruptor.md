### Corruptor
Corruptors are hosts to an especially virulent strain of the Blight, a parasitic corruption that warps behavior and physiology. They grow aggressive and cruel with a twisted desire to inflict suffering. Their bodies show advanced sickness: deformities, suppurating sores and green-oozing lesions. Harder to kill than those bearing common strains, Corruptors also spread their condition; creatures infected by them become Corruptors in turn. Transmission is highest through fluid contact from lesions or feeding wounds; early signs include heat intolerance, light aversion, and compulsive stalking behavior.
