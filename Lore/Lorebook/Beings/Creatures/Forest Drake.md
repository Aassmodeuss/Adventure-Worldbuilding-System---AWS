### Forest Drake
Forest drakes are large, wingless reptilians of the upper canopy, their iridescent scales catching dappled light. Some reach thirty feet in length. Carnivorous by nature, they prey on giant insects, small treants and other canopy fauna and are fiercely territorial, defending their spans from rival drakes and other predators. Adapted to the arboreal environment, they bask to slow their hunger and can endure months or years between kills. Iridescent scale plates host symbiotic chlorophyll, enabling limited photosynthesis at rest to supplement energy and reduce water loss; they remain carnivores. They are related to dragons but lack wings, breath attacks and the heightened intelligence of their greater kin.
