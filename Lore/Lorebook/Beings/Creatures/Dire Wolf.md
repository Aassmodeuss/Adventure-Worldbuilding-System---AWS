[ENTRY: Dire\ Wolf]

#### [Creature]
**Name:** Dire Wolf
**Aliases:** Great Wolf, Longstride
**Summary:** Dire wolves are large, bear-sized wolves adapted for endurance hunting and capable of unsettling entire regions with their presence. Their packs use steady pressure to pursue large prey across varied terrain.
**Full Description:** Dire wolves are massive predators with broad chests, deep lungs, and a long stride that allows them to maintain a steady lope for hours. Their heavier jaws and thick ruffs provide leverage and protection when bringing down large prey. Compared to common wolves, they leave deeper tracks and carry more scent, making them less subtle but well-suited to endurance hunting. Packs favor sustained pursuit over reckless attacks, often working riverbars, open forest lanes, and broken slopes. Their size allows them to turn a flank in open terrain. The presence of a single dire wolf unsettles most animals, while a pack's chorus can clear a valley. They are endurance predators adapted to long patrols and rough-country pursuit.
**Tone Keywords:** predatory, enduring, intimidating
**Habitats:** riverbars, open forest lanes, broken slopes
**Risk and Countermeasures:** Dire wolves pose a significant threat to livestock and travelers. Avoid known patrol routes and use fire or noise to deter packs.
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**
- Livestock disappearances traced to dire wolf hunting grounds
- A valley emptied of wildlife after a pack's arrival
- Unusual tracks found near settlements during migration season
