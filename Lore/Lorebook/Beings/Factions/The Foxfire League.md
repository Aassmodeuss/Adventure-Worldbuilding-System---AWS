### The Foxfire League
The surviving rangers who refused to follow Malakai Ashwood formed an underground resistance called the Foxfire League. The Foxfire League fought a decades long resistance agains Malakai's regime. The Foxfire League assassinated ranking members of Malakai's government, burned warehouses and sacked trade routs but after many years of fighting and much loss of life they were unable to overthrow him. Desperate and short on men and resources the Foxfire League turned to Elowyn Oakenheart, a respected leader of the League to come up with a plan. Most of the Foxfire League were killed when one of their members betrayed them to Malakai Ashwood.
