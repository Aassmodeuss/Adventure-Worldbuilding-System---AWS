### Pentad
The Pentad are five powerful figures who rule Stormthroat with iron fists wrapped in velvet. Their influence touches every river transaction, from illicit agreements to fatal reprisals; they control the flow of goods, information and lives through an equilibrium of intimidation and mutually assured destruction. Each oversees a sphere of business without overt interference, though their paths cross in grimy backrooms and private docks where blood and coin change hands. They treat Stormthroat as a complex game of overlapping interests where alliances shift like the sands of the Storm's Head River.
