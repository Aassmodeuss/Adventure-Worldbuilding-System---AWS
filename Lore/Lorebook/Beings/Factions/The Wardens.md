### The Wardens
The Wardens are a volunteer order patrolling the borders of the Forsaken Lands to keep the Blight and its creatures from spreading into the Greenwood. Funded by independent settlements and founded by surviving Varden Rangers after the Battle of the Whispering Caverns, they specialize in tracking and hunting blighted threats. Wardens are skilled woodsmen-hunters, trackers, archers and fighters-who patrol alone or in small groups along the shifting borders of the Forsaken Lands.

Many Wardens are Baned, former criminals or social outcasts; the order accepts anyone who swears the Warden oath. Membership is for life and past crimes are pardoned, but oath-breakers are hunted down and executed by their former comrades. The Warden life is short and brutal, leaving only a few hundred active across the Greenwood at any time.
