#### [Faction]
**Name:** Caravan Guild  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:** A trade consortium that coordinates convoy routes, escorts, and water purchases across the Ashlands and Eastwood. Maintains an outpost in Ash Hollow.  
**Full Description:** The Guild sets shared schedules so caravans do not drain a single spring at once, then posts rates and escort contracts at agreed stops. Factors in Ash Hollow buy water in bulk under Vexa's quotas and resell by allotment, recording every barrel against stamped tallies. Guild masters bargain tolls at walled ports along the Storm's Head River and blacklist slavers who raid under truce. Chapters operate with lean staff and hire locals as scouts and guards during peak season.  
**Tone Keywords:** pragmatic, itinerant, ledger, convoy, negotiation  
**Aligned Characters:** Vexa Blackslate  
**Known Locations:** Ash Hollow, Caravan Guild Office, Storm's Throat  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Close ranks against a price-fixing scheme at the well, audit tallies and expose forged stamps.  
- Secure a multi-caravan convoy through the Ashlands, balance speed, water use, and escort rotations.  
- Negotiate a joint toll with the Pentad at Storm's Throat, trade seasonal access for contraband amnesty.
