### Stormpeak Clan
The Stormpeak clan are a once mighty dwarven clan who reside within the Stormpeak Mountains. They distrust outsiders and especially hate humans. Many dwarves were enslaved by human rulers and forced to build weapons and magical constructs during the Crown Wars. The Stormpeak clan were especially affected by enslavement due to their former size and their openness to trade with humanity. Once among the largest clans in Elrune, they now number only a few thousand due to losses to slavers and wartime conscription, as well as dwarves' naturally low birth rate. The clan has been slowly recovering despite being in a near-constant war with many of the more hostile races living within the Rootlands below their hold.
