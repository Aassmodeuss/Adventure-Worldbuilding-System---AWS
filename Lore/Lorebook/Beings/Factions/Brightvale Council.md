[ENTRY: Brightvale Council]

#### [Faction]
**Name:** Brightvale Council  
**Aliases:** Council of Brightvale, Hollow Elders  
**Summary:** A council of elders who govern Brightvale Hollow, oversee canopy works, and negotiate trade with nearby posts.  
**Full Description:** The council sets resin and cordage rations, assigns bridge crews, and certifies hunters for mid-bough patrols. Elders arbitrate disputes and record decisions on bark tablets hung in the inner trunk. They trade surplus resin and dried fruit with Westwood posts and refuse river syndicate tolls that would pull the hollow into lowland politics. During storm season they seal the knot door and post watches until branches dry.  
**Tone Keywords:** communal, pragmatic, vigilant, canopy, stewardship  
**Aligned Characters:** None recorded  
**Known Locations:** Brightvale Hollow, Westwood  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Allocate cordage after a storm snaps the crown bridges, pick which link repairs first.  
- Negotiate a fair swap with a Westwood post, trade resin for tools without debt strings.  
- Resolve a hunter's grievance over patrol routes, balance safety and forage lines.
