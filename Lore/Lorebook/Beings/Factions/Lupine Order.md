### Lupine Order
A reclusive order of Human Rangers who arrived in Greenwood in the year 410:AF 
Their origins are unknown but it is rumoured they were exiled or chose to exile themselves from their homeland after they lost favour with the ruling powers. 
Their symbol is a silver wolf's head with one black eye and one white eye. 
An independent organization, they were often contracted by the High Council of Verdant Hall for missions that were either too dangerous or too morally grey for assignment to the Varden Rangers' elite squads which lead to much animosity between the Lupine order and the Varden Rangers 
Their reclusive nature, moral ambiguity and often brutal tactics fostered many unsubstantiated rumours regarding the Lupine Order such as all their members being werewolves or shifters.
All records of the Lupine Order end after 512:AF after one final assignment from the High Council. All later reports of sightings and communication with members of the order are unsubstantiated.
