### Storm's Head River Syndicates
Loose confederations of pilots, haulers and fence-masters work the Storm's Head River without pledging to any single boss. They run escorts, levy ad-hoc tolls at narrow bends, move contraband and arrange salvage runs along cliff stairs and hidden coves from the Stormpeak foothills to the Ashlands. When they pass Stormthroat, they pay the Pentad's due and keep their autonomy upriver and downriver; beyond the chain-gates, the river answers to whoever can read its currents and keep a crew fed.

Deals are struck beneath the chain-gates or at moonlit moorings. Payment may be coin, rumor or a carved driftwood marker burned with passage signs that buy one night of safe water. The Pentad breaks those who cheat inside the throat, but even they rely on syndicate pilots.
