[ENTRY: Ashlander Tribes]

#### [Faction]
**Name:** Ashlander Tribes  
**Aliases:** Ashlanders, Ashland clans  
**Summary:** Desert tribes of mixed races locked in constant conflict, raiding and pillaging to control wells and seeps.  
**Full Description:** Bands travel fixed routes between wells and seeps. Each band claims sources and enforces ration rules with guards. They raid rivals for barrels, livestock, tools, and captives. Truces last a season at most, then break when a spring drops or a chief falls. Outsiders pay steep water tolls or bring escorts; those who refuse are stripped and turned back into the flats.  
**Tone Keywords:** scarcity, vendetta, raiding, drought, clan-law  
**Aligned Characters:** None recorded  
**Known Locations:** Ashlands, Ash Hollow  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Mediate water access at a contested seep, set a rotation and stamp system  
- Retrieve stolen barrels after a dusk raid, choose pursuit or ambush at the next waypoint  
- Hire a storm guide for a crossing, pay in water, metal, or protection
