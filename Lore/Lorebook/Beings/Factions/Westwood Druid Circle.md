### Westwood Druid Circle
The Westwood Druid Circle is a group of ancient druids residing in the Westwood region of Greenwood Forest. Led by Elder Elerin Oak, they include Elder Linden, Lysandra Shadowfall, Elder Thorn, and Elder Asha. Each member possesses vast knowledge and immense power, acquired over the millennia they have spent watching over the Greenwood. They convene in a sacred grove, discussing matters of nature, corruption and the Blight's influence. The Circle holds significant authority and wisdom, often guiding younger druids in their quests. Despite their ancient age, they remain vigilant, ensuring the balance of nature within their domain. The Circle is of the few institutions of the Greenwood that survived the Shattering.
