#### [Character]
**Name:** Juno Vintree  
**Aliases:** None Recorded
**Summary:**  A Kitsune Varden Ranger and Foxfire League operative, Juno vanished in the Whispering Caverns months before the destruction of Verdant Hall. Presumed father of Kieara Oakenheart, his legacy sits under a cloud of rumor.  
**Full Description:**  Juno fought beside Elowyn Oakenheart against Malakai's rise, running reconnaissance and courier work for the Foxfire League. On a covert mission into the Whispering Caverns to secure a powerful artifact, he disappeared alongside his friend Zarun Willowdale. No bodies, messages, or signs were recovered; once they entered the Caverns, all contact ceased. Some Foxfire veterans whisper that either Juno or Zarun betrayed the League to Malakai; others argue the mission was compromised from the start.
