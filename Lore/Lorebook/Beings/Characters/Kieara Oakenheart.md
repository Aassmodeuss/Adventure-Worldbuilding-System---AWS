#### [Character]
**Name:** Kieara Oakenheart  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:**  A Kitsune ranger born on the night of Verdant Hall's destruction, Kieara hunts corrupted threats across the Greenwood. Reserved and exacting, she trusts slowly and keeps family history close.  
**Full Description:**  Short and light, with green eyes and a prehensile tail used for balance and clear shows of mood, Kieara moves with fox-born agility and sharp senses. Elowyn's final spell shielded her amid Verdant Hall's collapse; Lyra Oakenheart raised her in Westwood Grove alongside cousin Mia. At thirteen she learned the truth and received Elowyn's ranger amulet, then drove herself into hard training. She left the Grove at eighteen, chafing at strict treatment and pressure to follow a druid path. Now she works as a ranger and guide, taking Warden contracts against corrupted threats and speaking little of blood ties.  
**Tone Keywords:** resilience, reserve, precision, duty, trauma

- Elowyn's amulet keys a hidden Foxfire cache beneath a ruined treetop span.  
- Choice of rites: accept a Westgrove druid trial or swear the Warden oath.  
- Track a Corruptor through Shadowlands chokepoints using canopy routes.
