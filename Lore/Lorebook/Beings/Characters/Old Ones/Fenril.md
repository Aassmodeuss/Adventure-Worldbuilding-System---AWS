#### [Character]
**Name:** Fenril the Great Wolf  
**Aliases:** The First Wolf, Wolffather, Father Wolf  
**Summary:**  Fenril embodies the pack bond and persistence in the hunt. He is the primal spirit of unity through shared purpose and endurance.  
**Full Description:**  Forged by the Spirit of the Green at the dawn of life, Fenril is the first ancestor and guardian spirit of all wolves. His form is that of a horse-sized grey dire wolf with ice-blue eyes and a voice that rumbles like distant thunder. Cheerful and cunning, he tempers ferocity with loyalty, teaching that strength lies in cooperation rather than domination. Close companion to Corvath the Raven King, Fenril grants those who bind to him the wolf aspect, marking them as **Kinsoul Shifters**-mortals who inherit aspects of his instinct, discipline, and spirit harmony.  
**Tone Keywords:** unity, endurance, loyalty, cunning, perseverance

- Druids or shifters may invoke him to strengthen group coordination or resist fear effects.  
- Communion with Fenril within the Dreamworld can awaken dormant wolfblood lineage or lost shifter abilities.  
- Ancient cairns blessed in his name grant travelers heightened senses when they travel together.
