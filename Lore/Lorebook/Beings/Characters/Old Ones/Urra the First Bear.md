[Character]
**Name:** Urra the First Bear  
**Aliases:** The Sleeper in the Stone, Mother of Claws  
**Summary:**  The primal spirit of protection and fury, Urra embodies the instinct to defend what endures. To the Bearclaw shifters she is ancestor, guardian, and judge.  
**Full Description:**  Said to have risen from the roots of the Wyrmspine Mountains before mortals learned speech, Urra's strength is the Greenwood's patience made flesh. In the present age she dwells within the Dreamworld, her form immense and half-seen - fur like storm clouds, breath rolling with the slow thunder of stone. Druids and shamans claim her blessing tempers rage into resolve, yet those who betray kin or land feel her claws in waking dreams. Only the Bearclaw shifters and other keepers of the old ways still seek her directly; all others speak her name only when warding graves or crossing deep passes.  
**Tone Keywords:** endurance, wrath, motherhood, protection, reverence  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Shamanic dream-walking quests may allow communion with Urra for boons or omens.  
- Her presence could stabilize or enrage Bear-aligned magic, altering outcomes in spirit-realm encounters.  
- A dormant shrine in the Wyrmspine Mountains might hold remnants of her physical power awaiting renewal.
