#### [Character]
**Name:** Spirit of the Green  
**Aliases:** the Green  
**Summary:** The embodied will of nature binding all worlds. She does not address mortals and almost never acts directly.  
**Full Description:** Wardens and druids infer her will from natural shifts: sudden die-offs, stalled blooms, and redirected migrations. She answers through patterns, not speech, and avoids manifesting in the mortal world. Her presence favors nature magic bound to seasonal cycles; rigid Weave workings falter near living groves. When corruption grows beyond seasonal correction, the Old Ones cross from the Dreamworld to act in her stead. Their interventions leave scars in the land that flare when similar harms return.  
**Tone Keywords:** cyclical, distant, implacable, balance, indirect  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Keep a season-long vigil to align a grove, receive a subtle boon bound to local cycles.  
- Trace a recurring ecological scar to forecast where the next corruption surge will break.  
- Perform a rite of noninterference to request Old One attention, accept binding limits on magic use.
