#### [Character]
**Name:** Elder Asha  
**Aliases:** Grove-Mother, Keeper of Rings  
**Summary:** Senior druid of the Westwood Circle, Asha arbitrates disputes and reads the Greenwood's slow changes like rings in cut wood. Her counsel defers panic and steers scarce resources.  
**Full Description:** Centuries old, Asha speaks with the cadence of wind through leaves, measuring words and consequences. She maps blight spread by scent and soil texture, and she trains younger druids to listen before they act. Animals attend her presence, not as pets, but as watchers who relay patterns across groves. In council she pushes for measured burns and careful harvests, preserving resilience over spectacle.  
**Tone Keywords:** patient, judicious, ecological, mentor, restraint  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Conduct a soil and spore survey for Asha to set a controlled burn perimeter.  
- Mediate a resource dispute between Wardens and a treetop village under her guidance.  
- Learn a rite that detects early Blight, limited by moon phase and living roots.
