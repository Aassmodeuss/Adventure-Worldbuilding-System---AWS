#### [Character]
**Name:** Zarun Willowdale  
**Aliases:** Wayfinder, Silent Spur  
**Summary:**  A Kitsune Varden Ranger and Foxfire League operative, Zarun vanished in the Whispering Caverns months before the destruction of Verdant Hall. Mate to Lyra Oakenheart and father of Mia, his fate remains unproven.  
**Full Description:**  Zarun partnered with Juno Vintree on deep runs for the Foxfire League, handling long-route navigation and strike support during Malakai's rise. On a covert push to secure a powerful artifact within the Whispering Caverns, both men disappeared. No bodies, messages, or signs were ever recovered; once they entered the Caverns, all contact ceased. Rumor divides the League-either man may have betrayed the mission, or Malakai's readers broke their ciphers and set the ambush. Old rumours among members the Foxfire League hint at a private bond between Zarun and Elowyn that never reached the Circle's ledgers.
