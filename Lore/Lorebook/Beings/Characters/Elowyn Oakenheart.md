#### [Character]
**Name:** Elowyn Oakenheart  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:**  A Kitsune druid and one of the Foxfire League's founding members, Elowyn chose forbidden rites to end Malakai's rise. She died on the night of Verdant Hall's destruction; many who know of her blame her for the Shattering.  
**Full Description:**  Elowyn left her druid circle and, with surviving Varden Rangers, founded the Foxfire League rebellion against Malakai Ashwood. Years of losses drove her to study ancient, forbidden Kitsune magic seeking a decisive end. In 700:AF her final spell struck the corrupted Heart of the Forest; the interaction shattered the artifact and destroyed Verdant Hall. Her last act shielded her unborn daughter, Kieara, who was later found alive within the ruins. Elowyn's legacy divides Greenwood, martyr to some, catalyst to others.
