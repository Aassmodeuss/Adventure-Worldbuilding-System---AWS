#### [Character]
**Name:** Elder Linden  
**Aliases:** Night-Wing, Speaker for Spirits  
**Summary:** An ancient druid of the Westwood Circle who takes the form of a great owl. He keeps record of pacts and lost rites, and speaks with spirits others miss.  
**Full Description:** Linden's silver eyes and reserved posture hide a mind that catalogs whispers. He prefers twilight patrols as an owl, mapping paths through air currents and memory. When he returns to council he presents precise reports, feather-marked and dated, resisting calls to act on rumor. He binds the Circle to promises made, even when convenience argues otherwise.  
**Tone Keywords:** austere, precise, watchful, honor-bound, archival  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Retrieve a broken pact-token to settle an old debt with a grove spirit.  
- Assist a night flight to chart new currents over Shadowlands canopies.  
- Learn a spirit-listening vigil that reveals echoes, requires silence and fasting.
