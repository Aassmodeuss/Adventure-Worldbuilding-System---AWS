#### [Character]
**Name:** Lysandra Shadowfall  
**Aliases:** Scoutmaster  
**Summary:** Ancient druid who commands Westwood's scout network and border security. She rejects the title of Elder, preferring the field and the panther's form.  
**Full Description:** Reports from every canopy watch post pass through Lysandra's hands, annotated and cross-checked against her own patrols. She spends more time beyond the Grove than within it, mapping routes, contacts, and syndicate movements. She speaks plainly in council, dropping critical intelligence without ceremony, then returns to the trees. Lethra Vinecaller, lead scout, her apprentice and second, manages rotations when Lysandra is occupied with circle business.  
**Tone Keywords:** vigilant, pragmatic, decisive, clandestine, farsight

- Run a silent reconnaissance of Shadowlands margins to update safe crossing markers.  
- Feed counter-intel to river syndicates to divert raiders from a vulnerable treetop village.
