#### [Character]
**Name:** Malakai Ashwood  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:**  The charismatic Bosari commander of the Varden Rangers who seized Verdant Hall through a coup, Malakai turned to forbidden arts to avert visions of ruin and became the author of one. Wounded during the Shattering, he fled to the Whispering Caverns and was later presumed dead in the collapse of 702:AF.  
**Full Description:**  In his later years Malakai's visions of the destruction of Verdant Hall drove him to research forbidden magic and extend his life by any means. In 635:AF he led a venture into the Whispering Caverns seeking artifacts and knowledge to forestall disaster. He returned changed, calm, certain, and intolerant of delay. After his return he gathered loyalists, rewrote patrol orders, and centralized supply. In 639:AF he stormed the High Council's chamber and declared them as traitors to Greenwood, beginning purges across outposts and villages. In 700:AF Elowyn Oakenheart wounded him amid the Heart of the Forest's destruction; he retreated to the Whispering Caverns and, in 702:AF, was presumed killed when the tunnels came down.
