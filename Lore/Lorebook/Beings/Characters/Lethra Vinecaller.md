[ENTRY: Lethra Vinecaller]

#### [Character]
**Name:** Lethra Vinecaller

**Summary:** Lead scout of Westgrove, Vinecaller and Lysandra Shadowfall's second. She maps canopy routes and tracks blighted creatures along the rim of Westgrove territory.  
**Full Description:** Lethra runs long patrols above the forest floor and leaves coded twig marks on key spans. She reads bark scars and spoor to judge risk and reroutes caravans when predators climb. She favors rope hooks, a longbow, and light nature craft to mute scent and sound. She reports to Lysandra Shadowfall and carries orders without fuss. Long solo runs wear her thin, but she never leaves a watcher behind.  
**Tone Keywords:** vigilant, precise, relentless, covert, duty  
**Known Associates:** Westgrove, Westwood Druid Circle, Lysandra Shadowfall 
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Scout and mark a bypass around a new Blight seep, pull a caravan through before night  
- Extract a stranded lookout from a failed span, choose speed or stealth  
- Shadow a river syndicate courier on canopy paths, confirm route without contact
