#### [Character]
**Name:** Dura Ironsights  
**Aliases:** Master Artificer of Stormpeak Hold  
**Summary:**  Stormpeak Hold's chief artificer and guild coordinator, Dura oversees forges, smelters, and mine-works with exacting standards. She balances dwindled resources against the clan's defense and trade needs.  
**Full Description:**  A middle-aged dwarf with iron-grey hair and a smith's posture, Dura inherited a hollowed infrastructure-sealed lower levels, aging gear trains, and brittle supply lines to the Ashlands. She allocates ore and labor across weaponworks, bolter shops, and tunnel supports, arguing for safety margins even when the clan pushes for output. Her ledgers note every cog and spring; her temper is saved for failures of craft. Dura's authority runs across guild benches, but she answers to the Stormpeak council.  
**Tone Keywords:** pragmatic, meticulous, dutiful, strained, flinty  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Commission a Dwarven bolter or accept a maintenance job to earn Stormpeak trust.  
- Expedite repairs in a sealed lower level where Blight and old traps complicate access.  
- Broker ore-for-arms deals between Stormpeak and river syndicates under the Pentad's eye.
