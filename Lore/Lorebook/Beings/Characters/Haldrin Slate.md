#### [Character]
**Name:** Haldrin Slate  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:** Haldrin Slate is the Bosari innkeeper of Hollow Oak Inn whose tidy habits and fair dealing grew from a failed early venture and a vow to keep travel civil.  
**Full Description:** Thick-built and soft-spoken, Haldrin straightens chairs and wipes tables before dawn; order calms him. His first attempt at a roadside stall collapsed after a partner skimmed seed credits, and he now keeps all ledgers visible. He collects route notes partly to help guests and partly to prove he will not be deceived again. He favors measured talk, lets louder voices expend themselves, then states terms plainly. He dislikes wasted stores more than lost profit and will trade margin for a calm common room. He overcommits during storm surges, sleeping last after converting alcoves to bunks, and fatigue sometimes makes him miss small tally errors. He maintains Grove relations with quiet gifts-clean water draws, respectful timing for meals around rites-and expects caravan bosses to match that tone.  
**Tone Keywords:** orderly, fair, cautious, patient, overextended  
**Known Associates:** Grove druids; Caravan Guild factors; itinerant guides  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Help Haldrin catch a subtle ledger slip caused by storm fatigue before disputes rise.  
- Intervene when an aggressive trader exploits his reluctance to escalate.  
- Recover seed credits stolen by a returning former partner seeking revenge.  
- Optimize bunk rotation so Haldrin rests, reducing future tally mistakes.
