#### [Character]
**Name:** Aeliana  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:** A dryad caretaker of a secluded grove, playful in manner and quick to aid travelers. She commands plant growth and calls woodland creatures when danger nears.  
**Full Description:** Of unknown age, Aeliana has spent nearly all her life within her grove with her sisters, leaving her naive about distant politics yet expert in living systems. She shifts into a towering sylvan form when pressed, bark plates rising like armor and vine lashes striking with precision. She prefers her natural nudity, though she veils herself in moss or leaf wrap when guests discomfort shows. Pale green skin and amber eyes mark her kind, with hair threaded in flowers that open or close with her mood.
