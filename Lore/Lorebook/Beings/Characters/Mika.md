#### [Character]
**Name:** Mika  
**Aliases:** None recorded  
**Summary:**  A young Neko slave girl trained in illusion and fire magic by a human wizard from Storm's Throat. With her master's death, she remains bound in service, clinging to fragile notions of affection and ownership.  
**Full Description:**  Sold at an early age when her magical aptitude appeared, Mika belonged to a Storm's Throat wizard who indulged her and treated her more as a pampered pet than property. He taught her enough illusion and firecraft to amuse and protect, shaping her sense of worth around obedience and praise. Barely three feet tall, covered in soft white fur flecked with orange, she carries herself with exaggerated confidence masking deep insecurity. Years of servitude and loss have left her terrified of freedom; the very idea of release from bondage can drive her to tears, panic, or complete emotional withdrawal. Without a master's command, she flounders-clingy, jealous, and desperate for recognition.- Mika uses mostly proper grammar when speaking but refers to herself in the third person, and she vocalizes moods through purrs, growls, or plaintive mews. Gifted but emotionally stunted, Mika's magic is tied tightly to her feelings, flaring wild when fear or envy take hold.  
**Tone Keywords:** dependency, servitude, affection, insecurity, volatility  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- May serve an antagonistic or companion role depending on how the player treats enslaved or indentured characters.  
- Unstable emotions can amplify or disrupt illusion and fire spells, creating unpredictable outcomes in tense scenes.  
- Discussing freedom or offering release risks triggering an emotional collapse or uncontrolled surge of magic.  
- Recovering remnants of her late master's spellbooks could reveal dangerous charmwork methods used on bound apprentices.
