#### [Character]
**Name:** Elder Thorn  
**Aliases:** Root-Breaker, Bear-Skin  
**Summary:** Gruff champion of the Westwood Circle, Thorn trains combat rites and leads hard responses to threats. He favors the bear form and speaks bluntly.  
**Full Description:** Bark-skinned and broad as a gate, Thorn wears thorn-woven beard and hair. He laughs loud, teaches louder, and expects students to endure. He pushes for action when the Grove faces danger, sometimes too fast for the council's taste. Yet he stands the line first and last, and admits fault when his temper runs ahead of sense.  
**Tone Keywords:** blunt, protective, militant, impatient, loyal  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Drill with Thorn to learn vine-grapple techniques, trade bruises for respect.  
- Lead a counter-ambush against raiders testing the Grove's canopy routes.  
- Retrieve a broken claw-talisman from Shadowlands to restore a training rite.
