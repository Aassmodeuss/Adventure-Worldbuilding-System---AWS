### Kitsune
Kitsune are native to the Greenwood-short, slim, fox-like humanoids. Fur covers most of the body; hands bear small retractable claws. Their bushy, prehensile tails aid climbing and fine tasks; keen hearing, night vision, and a sharp sense of smell suit canopy life. They are quick and agile but generally smaller and less physically strong than humans. Digitigrade legs make footwear uncommon.

Society centers on family honor and multi-generation households that are often polyamorous. Kin-groups form flexible households and bonded partnerships shaped by obligation and care rather than rigid pairings; adopting non-Kitsune mates into the family is not uncommon. Many communities organize into small tribal groups or village wards linked by kin alliances. A few lineages are very long-lived-some near millennia-a fact kept from shorter-lived neighbors to avoid envy.

Relations with the Bosari eased under Verdant Hall's peace. Since the city's fall, border tensions have risen again, though most disputes stop short of open war.
