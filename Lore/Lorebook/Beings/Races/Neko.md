[ENTRY: Neko]

#### [Race]
**Name:** Neko
**Aliases:** Greenwood Neko, Storm's Head Neko
**Summary:** Neko are small humanoids with cat features, known for agility and sharp senses. Most Greenwood Neko live in hidden canyon settlements and distrust magic and outsiders.
**Full Description:** Neko are petite humanoids with cat ears, long tails, and retractable claws. They lack physical strength but excel in agility, speed, and sensory perception. Greenwood Neko typically inhabit concealed settlements carved into the Storm's Head River canyon walls. Before the Wars of the Crowns, they traded upriver with Stormpeak Hold. Slavers frequently target isolated Neko communities, and captives are sold at high prices on southern routes. Outsiders often perceive Neko as unpredictable, childish, and attracted to bright objects. Neko communities fear most magic, shun their own who practice it, and sometimes sell magically gifted children. Leadership is held by respected shamans and wise women, who are not considered mages. Free Neko strongly oppose slavery and indenture and often distrust humans due to historical abuses.
