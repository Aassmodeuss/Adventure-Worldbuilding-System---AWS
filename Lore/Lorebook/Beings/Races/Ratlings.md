### Ratlings
Ratlings are ratlike people who dwell primarily in underground warrens. They exhibit bestial, violent tendencies and are widely regarded by other races as barely sentient. Extreme opportunists, they consume nearly anything-or anyone-they can overpower. Cowardly by nature, they rarely stand to fight, preferring ambush and surprise unless cornered or backed by overwhelming numbers.
