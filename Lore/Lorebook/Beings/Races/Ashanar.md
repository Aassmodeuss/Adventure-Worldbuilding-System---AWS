#### [Race]
**Name:** Ashanar
**Aliases:** None known
**Summary:** Ashanar are tall, feathered canopy-dwellers who glide between treetop homes and maintain ancient suspended walkways. Their society is organized into nomadic clans led by elder councils.
**Full Description:** The Ashanar inhabit forest canopies, using elongated limbs and gliding wings to move between elevated dwellings. Their large, iridescent eyes detect subtle changes in wind and motion. They glide rather than fly, relying on height and favorable winds. Ashanar society is structured into nomadic clans governed by councils of elders. Many Ashanar practice aeromancy, using wind guidance for migration and decision-making. They are reclusive and defend their traditions when threatened. Ashanar craftsmen maintain the High Road, a canopy path network that predates the Shattering. Notable individuals include Elder Marik and Scout Lira.
