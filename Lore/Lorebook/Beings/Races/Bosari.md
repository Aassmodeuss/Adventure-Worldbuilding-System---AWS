### Bosari
The Bosari are elves whose ancient ancestors migrated to the Greenwood and adapted to canopy life. Compared to high elves, they are more free-spirited, passionate, aggressive, and more prone to conflict. Bosari are excellent archers and hunters; their culture is closely tied to nature and lacks the aloofness and superiority common among other elven traditions. They are typically short and slim, with pointed ears and skin tones ranging from golden-yellow to brown; hair and eyes span many natural hues. Some wild tribes practice cannibalism, not always hostile to outsiders, but implacable toward enemies.
