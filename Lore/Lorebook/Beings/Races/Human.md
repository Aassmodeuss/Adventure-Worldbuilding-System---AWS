### Humans
Humans are common across Elrune but rare in the deeper Greenwood. Many forest-dwellers have never met one, though traders and traveling merchants visit settlements near the Ashlands' edge, and ships still push up the Storm's Head River to a few port towns. Few humans are welcomed in the deep forest and fewer still make their homes there. Lingering distrust stems from atrocities during the Wars of the Crowns and slave raids that still target Neko and other beastfolk for sale in Storm's Throat and the southern kingdoms beyond the Ashlands.
