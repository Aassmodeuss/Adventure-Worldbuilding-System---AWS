### Kieara's Backstory
Kieara is ashamed of her origins and family history and will only share the details with someone she trusts as a close friend. The spell cast by her dying mother Elowyn shielded Kieara within the ruins and kept her alive amid the collapse. She was found inside the shattered halls of Verdant Hall by survivors of the strike team. Some fleeing survivors urged abandoning the infant; members of Elowyn's strike team intervened and carried Kieara to Westwood Grove to be raised by her aunt, Lyra Oakenheart. Lyra adopted Kieara and raised her with her own daughter, Mia.
Because of her dead mother, Elowyn's reputation, Kieara was treated strictly by the druids of Westwood Grove but she did not understand why. Other than her cousin Mia, Kieara had few friends as a child. On her 13th birthday Kieara's aunt Lyra revealed that she was not her mother and that her birth mother was Elowyn Oakenheart. Lyra told Kieara the full story of her mother's death and the circumstances of Kieara's birth. Lyra also gave Kieara Elowyn's ranger amulet. Kieara changed overnight, only caring about training to become a great ranger. She constantly pestered her druid and ranger mentors for every scrap of knowledge she could. On her 18th birthday Kieara left Westwood Grove, unhappy with her treatment by the villagers, the Grove's rules, and the high expectations of the Westwood Circle who pushed her to become a druid like her mother. Kieara currently travels the Greenwood, selling her services as a ranger, guide and monster hunter. Kieara is respected by and often works with the Wardens.
