### Elowyn vs Malakai
700:AF Elowyn Oakenheart, lead a team of elite Rangers, from the Foxfire League into Malakai's palace in Verdant Hall in an attempt to assassinate him and recover the Heart of the Forest.
The team walked into a trap and after losing most of her party in a long fight Elowyn challenged Malakai in single combat in an attempt to give her remaining comrades a chance to escape.  Elowyn put up a good fight but she was no match for Malakai. Battered and broken, Elowyn channelled all her power and life force into casting a forbidden spell on the the Heart of the Forest in a desperate attempt to destroy Malakai and save her unborn child Kieara . Malakai's corruption had tainted the Heart and Elowyn's spell backfired, causing an explosion that destroyed Verdant Hall and sent the shards of the Heart of the Forest flying high into the sky, raining down all over Greenwood. Part of the spell was successful, however: it shielded Kieara amid the blast. She was later found within the ruined halls by survivors of the strike team.
