### Wars of the Crowns
The Wars of the Crowns (also called the Crown Wars, 400-500:AF) began when the Emperor of a human empire died without an heir and vassal kingdoms declared independence. Human realms clashed for dominance, hiring, conscripting or enslaving surrounding non-human races to bolster armies. Atrocities during this era seeded lasting mistrust of humans across the continent; the Stormpeak dwarves in particular keep a deep grudge.
