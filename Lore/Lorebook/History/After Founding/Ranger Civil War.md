### Ranger Civil War 
The Ranger Civil War was a long and bloody conflict between the members of the Varden Rangers who supported Malakai Ashwood in his coup, and the Rangers who were still loyal to the old system and fought to overthrow him and restore some form of democracy to Verdant Hall. The civil war ended when Malakai was defeated in the Battle of the Whispering Caverns.
