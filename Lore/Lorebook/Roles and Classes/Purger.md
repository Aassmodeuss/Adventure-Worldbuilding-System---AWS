### Purger

[ENTRY: Purger]

#### [Class]
**Name:** Purger  
**Summary:** Elite Warden hunters who track and eliminate Corruptors, using ambush tactics, fire, and disciplined coordination.  
**Full Description:** Purgers are selected from veteran Wardens for field craft, patience, and precision. Teams map movement patterns, seed kill-zones, and cut retreats before the first arrow flies. Toxin work is common: nightshade, wyvern venom, and blight-targeting salves weaken or mark prey. Fire magic and shamanic training are assets but not required; archery excellence is typical. Their mandate is containment and eradication of Corruptors, regardless of cost.  
**Tone Keywords:** relentless, methodical, covert, sanction, containment  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Seed a multi-stage ambush on a corruptor's route, hold the line when it charges.  
- Brew and test a new toxin blend, gather reagents under time pressure.  
- Extract a wounded Purger team without revealing the kill-zone.
