[ENTRY: Vinecaller]

#### [Class]
**Name:** Vinecaller  
**Summary:** Druids who command vines and plants through wild magic to defend territory, shield allies, and hinder foes.  
**Full Description:** A Vinecaller is a druid who communicates with and controls the vines and plants of the Greenwood, using wild magic to influence the natural world. Vinecallers like Lethra prioritize territory and community, channeling growth to raise thorn barriers, entangle foes, and sustain themselves when resources run thin. Their abilities are fueled by deep bonds to the land and its living network. Skilled herbalism is common, and many pursue healing or alchemy. The most powerful can assume a treant-like form for brief, taxing surges of strength.  
**Tone Keywords:** verdant, protective, rooted, adaptive  
**Potential Gameplay Hooks:**  
- Fortify a settlement trail with living barricades before a blighted migration.  
- Brew restorative draughts from rare blooms under an imminent frost.  
- Invoke treant-form to break a siege, then cope with post-ritual weakness.
