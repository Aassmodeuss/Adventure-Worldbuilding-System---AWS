### Shifter
Shifters are beings bonded to a primal animal spirit, one of the Old Ones. Even in natural form they wear subtle marks of the bond, such as wolfish eyes or sharpened hearing. Their abilities flow from intent, need and instinct, often manifesting unpredictably until tempered by experience. Shifters can be extremely long-lived and do not age, but they must control the animal nature within or risk losing themselves to it. Training from another shifter, druid or spirit guide can hasten mastery.

Shifters resist charms, curses and most magic; as their power grows this resistance approaches near-immunity. They are immune to nearly all known poisons and diseases, and heal far faster than mortals. Minor wounds in minutes, serious injuries in hours or days, with the speed of regeneration increasing as their power grows. Shifters can transform their bodies to meet circumstance, and their spirit bond lets them perceive and manipulate the natural weave of magic: sensing enchantments, disrupting another caster's workings and bypassing wards. By tapping primal forces through the bond, a shifter may mimic basic spells without weaving formal patterns. Nearby magic or spellcasting pricks their senses like a sharp burning scent.
