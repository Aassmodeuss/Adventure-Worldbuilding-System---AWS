### 4. Wolfspeech
Wolfspeech allows those with wolfblood to commune with wolves and other canids through a direct mental link. Rather than words, the exchange carries feelings, images and scents, impressions layered with instinct. The bond projects across any distance a wolf's howl could carry, letting speaker and pack converse over the forest's breadth.

### 5. Feral Form
Wolfblood Shifters can assume a feral form, molding their bodies to immediate need. Rapid shifts are painful as bones and muscles reconfigure. In combat this form broadens the arms, hands and fingers to nearly double size while sickle-shaped claws bloom to rend flesh and leather; wolf-like teeth sharpen for tearing. Agility, strength and speed all heighten, yet a mostly human silhouette remains beneath the changes.

### 6. Wolf Form
A Wolfblood Shifter can take a true wolf shape, dropping to a four-legged gait as the spine lengthens and the body flows close to the ground. The change favors endurance and quiet strength. Paws spread to soften steps, lungs deepen and the world blooms in scent and sound. Night vision sharpens and the nose reads wind sheets and old tracks that a human eye would miss.

In this form the shifter trades hands for speed and stealth. Tools and bows are set aside, balance, teeth and claws do the work. Wolfspeech becomes instinctive, carrying intent, maps of scent and simple plans between the Wolfblood Shifter and canid allies without a sound. Howls carry mood and direction across valleys when silence is no longer needed.

The wolf form is steady and well suited to travel, scouting and flanking. It holds close to the edge of frenzy but does not court it; discipline keeps the hunt clean. Pack sense runs strong here. Many who master this form describe a lingering calm after they rise, as if the heart remembered a simpler rhythm.

### 7. Tree Wolf Form
Some Wolfblood Shifter develop a canopy variant of the wolf shape for greenway travel. Limbs lengthen slightly and wrists gain a flexible cant; forepaws spread with longer, hooking claws for grip. The tail thickens for counterbalance and the spine coils for upward spring. A thin web of skin lies along the flanks from wrist to hip and can unfurl to catch air on a leap, with the tail trimming direction like a rudder. Pads harden along the outer edge to bite bark without slipping.

The tree wolf moves branch to branch in short, silent bounds and clambers near-vertical trunks with practiced rhythm. From above it scouts, shadows and bypasses ground sign without leaving a trail. With the webbing deployed it can cross wider gaps in a shallow glide, skimming ravines and river cuts that stop ground pursuit. Ground speed drops compared to the true wolf form and long runs will fatigue forelimbs first, and glides need height and a clean landing, but stealth, angles of approach and escape routes multiply in dense woods. This is not flight; the glide only manages descent, and crosswinds or heavy loads reduce control.

### 9. Greater Tree Wolf Form
A bear-sized canopy runner built for power and reach above the forest floor. The shoulders and hips broaden, the forelimbs lengthen and knot with climbing muscle and the tail thickens further for counterbalance. Forepaws widen with long, hooking claws and developed dewclaws that act like spurs. Pads along the outer edge harden to bite rough bark under load.

The greater tree wolf travels the high road along primary limbs, taking measured two- or three-body-length leaps where the canopy allows. It can drop and catch on a trunk with foreclaws and chest, then spiral upward without breaking pace. From above it keeps a steady patrol, flanks in silence when wood is green and sound and chooses ambush angles no ground hunter can match.

Tradeoffs are real. Mass narrows the usable routes and demands constant reading of limb thickness, wind and rot. It is less subtle than the smaller tree wolf and sheds bark where wood is dry. Ground speed and agility fall below the dire wolf; this shape is strongest in trees and serviceable on the ground only when needed. Grip and forelimb muscles tire sooner on long crossings and require planned rests.



### 8. Dire Wolf Form
A Wolfblood Shifter can enlarge the wolf shape into a dire wolf, bear-sized and broad through the chest, with a longer stride and deeper lungs. The gait smooths into an easy lope that eats distance, and strength rises without losing the balance and flow of a true wolf. Teeth and jaws are heavier, the ruff thicker, the presence more intimidating.

This form is less subtle than the standard wolf form. It leaves deeper tracks, carries more scent and breathes louder under strain, yet it remains a fast endurance predator suited to travel and long patrols. It excels at steady pressure, pursuit over rough ground and bringing down larger prey without needing to resort to reckless charges.

Instinct runs hotter than in the common wolf shape but stays manageable with practiced checks, a counted breath, a glance to a packmate. Used well, the dire wolf form extends reach and stamina while keeping control. It is the Wolfblood Shifter's long-range answer when speed, endurance and presence must all arrive together.

### Wolfsoul Ascendant
The Wolfsoul Ascendant is a heightened hybrid shape that blends human poise with the Great Wolf's full savagery. Standing near eight feet tall on a digitigrade stance, it carries a deep chest, a heavy back and long forearms corded with muscle. Hands remain, but fingers lengthen and thicken into talons made for rending. The skull pulls forward into a powerful muzzle and the neck knots to anchor the bite. Eyes hold night clarity and a cold focus; ears and nose read the world in layers.

Movement is fluid and explosive. It can sprint on two legs, drop to a four-beat gallop for bursts and vault obstacles without breaking stride. Claws find purchase on timber and stone, letting it climb, cling and turn in tight spaces where a larger beast would fumble. Strikes break bone, grips hold through thrashing and the voice can roll from a low warning to a full, carrying howl that steadies allies of the old ways.

This shape is a burden as much as a gift. It draws hard on strength and discipline, and the pull of blood is strongest here. After the shift the body shakes with spent power and hunger; heat lingers beneath the skin and senses take time to settle. Used with restraint, the Wolfsoul Ascendant ends fights cleanly. Used without it, it burns the bearer down to the quick.

### 3. Blood Frenzy
Wolfblood Shifters must hold their wolfblood instincts in check or risk spiraling into blood frenzy. Rage, combat, threat, and the scent of an enemy's blood all tug at control. In frenzy the shifter turns reckless and irrational, thoughts consumed by the thrill of the fight and the taste of blood until discipline reasserts.


### 1. Wolfblood
Wolfblood ties a person closely to wolves and their kin. Passed down in dormant lines, it must be awakened through a binding ritual pledging oneself to the Great Wolf; only then does a bearer become a Wolfblood Shifter. Awakening stirs new powers and sharpened senses alongside formidable instincts that demand constant discipline. The last known carrier in Elrune died centuries ago.

A Wolfblood Shifter is a shifter who has bound to the Great Wolf's spirit. This bond grants all common shifter abilities plus distinctive wolflike traits: wolf-like eyes and excellent night vision, keen hearing and an acute sense of smell. As mastery grows, a Wolfblood Shifter can shift into varied forms to suit need, with the feral form being the most fundamental.



### 2. Binding Ritual (Wolfblood Awakening)
The Binding Ritual is an ancient act of communion through which one who bears the dormant Wolfblood awakens the spirit within and forges a bond to the primal essence of the wolf. No two rituals are ever the same - each takes shape according to instinct, will, and the soul of the one who calls.

It demands a personal offering - blood spilled upon the soil, breath surrendered beneath the moon, or another gesture of trust and surrender. Through this act, the veil between the mortal and the wild tears open. Power surges through the initiate as the Wolfblood stirs, answering with ancient hunger and boundless strength.

Then comes the flood of ancestral memory - a storm of images, sensations, and emotions from countless lives. The initiate glimpses hunts under forgotten moons, the warmth of pack and kin, the ecstasy of freedom and the madness of the chase. It is overwhelming - too much for a mortal mind to hold. The visions fade like a half-remembered dream, but they never truly vanish. Echoes of instincts and voices linger, whispering in moments of rage, fear, or longing.

When the ritual ends, the Wolfblood is awakened. The initiate's senses sharpen; their muscles hum with feral energy; their heart beats to the rhythm of the wild. Yet with this gift comes the burden of control. The call of the hunt, the thrill of dominance, and the taste of blood now sing within their veins. Every heartbeat is a balancing act between instinct and will - between human reason and the primal beast beneath.

Those who master the harmony between the two are transformed into true shifters, wielding their wild nature without being consumed by it. Those who falter risk surrendering to the frenzy, losing themselves to the relentless voice of the wolf within.
