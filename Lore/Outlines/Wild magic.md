### Wild magic
Wild magic is the ability to tap into the primal forces of nature. Similar to the nature magic of druids but instead of drawing from the spirits of the natural world wild magic focuses on drawing power from a primal totemic aspect of nature to cast spells. Wild magic does not require the same level of study and practice as other forms of magic, being fueled by need and controlled by the wielder's intent and sheer strength of will. Many spellcasters, especially wizards, don't respect users of wild magic, feeling that their lack of need for study and practice means they haven't earned the power they wield.
