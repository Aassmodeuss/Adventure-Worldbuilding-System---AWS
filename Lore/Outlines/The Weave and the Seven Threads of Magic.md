### The Weave and the Seven Threads of Magic

- Magic flows through the Weave — seven primal Threads each with it's own colour. Casters shape Threads into Patterns (spells).
- The threads of each school of magic has its own unique color
- The colour of the threads are dependent on their source and may be woven together in complex ways to create advanced spells.
- The threads of fire magic are orange.
- The threads of water and ice magic are blue,
- The threads of spirit magic are white.
- The threads of illusion magic are purple.
- The threads of death magic are black
- The threads of earth magic are brown
- The threads of air magic are grey
- The world uses the Weave: magic comes from combining elemental Threads for different effects. Death magic is considered taboo and is forbidden by most cultures in Elrune.
