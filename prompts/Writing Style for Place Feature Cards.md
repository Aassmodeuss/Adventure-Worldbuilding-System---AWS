# Writing Style — Place Feature Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Place Feature cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences defining the feature and its portable archetype.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences on how the feature expresses across different regions/biomes, what persists, and what adapts.
- Fill Summary and Full Description plus all other Card Fields present in the per‑type template. For list/reference Card Fields, include only items explicitly provided by the generator inputs or already present in the current card (for rewrites); otherwise leave them empty. Do not add new Card Fields.
- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.
- Name usage (Summary): Include the card's title name at least once.
- Name usage (Full Description): Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Definition of the feature archetype and its invariant traits.
- How it inherits or reflects the character of its host region/biome (what changes vs. what remains consistent).
- Typical manifestations, hazards/opportunities, and examples of local variations without naming unknown pages.
