# Writing Style — Creature Cards

Purpose
- Shapes Summary and Full Description for Beings: Creature cards. Consumed by `tools/cardgen.ps1` (script/API).

Output scope
- Summary: 1–2 sentences on defining traits and threat profile.
- Full Description: 3–8 sentences on morphology, habitat, behaviors, risk level, vulnerabilities, and encounter guidance.
- Fill Summary and Full Description plus all other Card Fields present in the per‑type template. For list/reference Card Fields, include only items explicitly provided by the generator inputs or already present in the current card (for rewrites); otherwise leave them empty. Do not add new Card Fields.
- Standalone sections: Summary and Full Description must each be independently understandable; do not refer to "above/below" or assume the other is read.
- Name usage (Summary): Include the card's title name at least once.
- Name usage (Full Description): Include the card's title name at least twice (natural usage; avoid repetition).

Voice and constraints
- Objective codex tone; concise; third‑person. Max 24 words per sentence. No semicolons. Avoid metaphors.

Coverage
- Morphology and distinct identifiers.
- Habitat range and environmental preferences.
- Typical behaviors (feeding, territory, pack/solitary) and triggers.
- Threats to travelers; vulnerabilities and avoidance/engagement guidance.
- Interactions with corruption or magic if established.

Canon and safety
- Do not invent novel abilities without explicit input; prefer conservative, field‑guide descriptions.
